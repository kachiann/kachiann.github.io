## INN Hotels Group: Predicting Booking Cancellations with Machine Learning

INN Hotels Group is addressing revenue loss from booking cancellations by developing a machine learning solution to predict cancellation probabilities. This initiative will allow us to take proactive measures to optimize our operations.

### Project Objective

We aim to create a machine learning model that will enable us to:

1. **Implement Dynamic Pricing**: Adjust room rates based on cancellation forecasts.
2. **Launch Targeted Retention Campaigns**: Identify high-risk bookings for personalized outreach.
3. **Optimize Overbooking Policies**: Manage reservations effectively to minimize revenue loss.

### Impact

By accurately predicting cancellations, INN Hotels Group will:

- **Minimize Inventory Loss**: Reduce unsold rooms due to cancellations.
- **Maximize Revenue**: Enhance pricing strategies based on data insights.
- **Improve Guest Satisfaction**: Offer personalized communication and fair pricing.
