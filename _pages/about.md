Welcome! I’m a data scientist and computational mathematician with a Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics from Johannes Kepler University, Austria. 

#### Reasearch
My expertise lies in advanced algorithms, with a particular focus on quasi-Monte Carlo methods. I have a strong background in both research and teaching.

I was a Senior Research Associate and Visiting Assistant Professor at the Illinois Institute of Technology, where I specialized in optimizing algorithm efficiency and contributed to cutting-edge computational projects. I’m passionate about data science and always eager to connect for insights, discussions, or collaborations.

#### Writing
I enjoy sharing insights on machine learning, data science, and their applications on Twitter and occasionally on my Medium blog.

Feel free to reach out via social media or email!
