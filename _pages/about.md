Welcome! I’m a data scientist and computational mathematician with a Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics from [Johannes Kepler University](https://www.jku.at) in Austria. 

#### Reasearch
My expertise is in developing advanced algorithms, particularly focusing on quasi-Monte Carlo methods, with extensive experience in both research and teaching.

I was a Senior Research Associate and Visiting Assistant Professor at the [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://www.iit.edu) in Chicago, USA,  where I specialized in optimizing algorithm efficiency and contributed to cutting-edge computational projects. I’m passionate about data science and always eager to connect for insights, discussions, or collaborations.

#### Writing
I enjoy sharing insights on machine learning, data science, and their applications on [Twitter](https://x.com/kachi_ann) and occasionally on my [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@kachiann).

Feel free to reach out via social media or [email](mailto:kachiann12@gmail.com)!
