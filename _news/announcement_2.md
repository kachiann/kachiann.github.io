I’m thrilled to announce the launch of my new Medium blog! As a data scientist with a Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics, I’ll be sharing my insights on data science, AI, and computational mathematics. Expect practical advice, tips, and in-depth explorations on topics like predictive modeling and data visualization.
