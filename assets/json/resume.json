    "summary": "This paper introduces an efficient reduced fast component-by-component digit-by-digit (CBC-DBD) algorithm for constructing lattice point sets in quasi-Monte Carlo integration. The method is particularly effective for weighted Korobov classes with rapidly decaying weights, offering computational efficiency independent of problem dimension under certain conditions. The algorithm achieves near-optimal convergence order and demonstrates significant speed improvements over previous methods."
